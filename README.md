# Bulls and Cows

This program is an advanced version of the classic code breaking game Bulls and Cows

# Description

First, the player is prompted to input the length of the secret code. Then, the player is prompted to enter the number of possible symbols in the code. Supported symmobls are numbers 0-9 and lowercase Latin characters a-z.
The program will then generate a secret code of the given length using the symbols specified by player. The maximum length for the code is 36.
Now, the program prompts the player to guess the secret code. When the player inputs a code, the program grades it in bulls and cows. The game goes on until the code is guessed. 

# Rules

If a character (0-9, a-z) in the input code matches a character and its position in the secret code, it's called a "bull". If a given character appears in the secret code but its position doesn't match, then it's called a "cow".
